# WebProjects

I’ve developed multiple web projects including an E-Commerce site with dynamic product listings, user authentication, and cart functionality that mirrors real-world platforms; a Restaurant website featuring intuitive menu navigation, reservation forms, and responsive design; and a front-end clone of Instagram’s login page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for precise UI replication and form validation. These projects allowed me to practice full stack fundamentals, strengthen my problem-solving skills, and apply my learning in practical, visually consistent applications.
